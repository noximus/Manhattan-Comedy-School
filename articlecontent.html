        Coming from a legendary funnyman such as Billy Connolly, these words need to be taken seriously. </p>
        <p>They were given as advice to CNN International Anchor Richard Quest  just four days before his next public appearance -- as a stand-up comedian at one of Broadway's top comedy clubs, Carolines. </p>
        <p>Club owner Caroline Hirsch isn't making Richard feel any better when he admits to being nervous at the thought of performing on a stage which has launched the careers of Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock and Jay Leno. </p>
        <p>"You have to go on that stage and you have to be able to control the people in the audience and that's a very, very difficult thing to do. Control them by being funny. Controlling them by having them wait for your next word and controlling them by making them laugh with you." </p>
        <p>Quest: "The danger, of course, is they laugh at me." </p>
        <p>Hirsch: "Yeah that could happen." </p>
        <p>It is the culmination of an international Quest for comedy. </p>
        <p>Richard has travelled to New York, Paris and London, talking with comedians, writers and comedy fans, getting inside their heads and seeking an answer to the question: "What is funny?" </p>
        <p>On the road he has rubbed funnybones with some of the brightest sparks in the comic world. </p>
        <p>Ricky Gervais burst onto the scene with the hilarious British spoof documentary "The Office", which has now been reworked for U.S. audiences. He is currently working on a follow-up about actors, entitled "Extras." </p>
      <p>Gervais confessed to Richard he felt guilty that success had come without years of hard work on the comedy circuit performing stand-up in smoky bar rooms for a fistful of dollars. </p>

      <p><img name="" src="images/story2.jpg" width="220" height="168" alt="" align="right">Richard meets the team behind the irreverent puppets to discover what can be learned from a French comic institution. </p>
      <p>In contrast to the script-writers, the producers and the expensive sets of TV shows like "Les Guignols," the stand-up comedian cuts a lonely figure, battling audiences alone -- as Richard is about to find out. </p>
      <p>Help comes in the form of Linda Smith, an Emmy-winning comic who imparts her experience to students who have signed up for a six-week course at the Manhattan Comedy School. </p>
      <p>But with four days to go before his own performance, Richard is finding it increasingly hard to laugh. </p>
      <p>You can follow Richard's comedy quest from classroom to comedy club as he battles to overcome fear of failure and comes face to face with a live audience -- instead of an autocue. </p></td>
