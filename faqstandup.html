  <strong>FAQ's about Stand-up Comedy Level I:</strong>  
  <p><strong>Q: How do you differ from your competitors?
  </strong>    
  <p>Our faculty is in a class by itself (pardon the pun). They don't have big egos or hidden agendas and they genuinely care about their students (as evidenced by the dozens of supportive referrals and testimonials we've received over the years). Furthermore, all of our instructors are working professionals -- people who deal with the inner workings of the comedy industry every day.
  <p>Finally, upon graduation, all Stand-up Level I students receive a broadcast-quality videotape of their performance. This is the very same tape that seasoned comics receive when they perform at New Talent Shows (several of which have resulted in people getting development deals).
  <p><strong>Q: I'm a little nervous and have never done this before. Am I going to be in a class with other beginners?
  </strong>
  <p>First of all, your nervousness is a good thing (it indicates that you're grounded in reality). But not to worry -- our teachers create a very safe and supportive atmosphere. And remember -- everyone in the room feels exactly the way you do.
  <p>It's important to note that at The Manhattan Comedy School, we really have only one 'hard and fast' rule that we enforce -- everyone must be supportive of their fellow students. We feel this is one of the reasons many of our students stay in touch even after graduating.
  <p><strong>Q: What is the class like?
  </strong>
  <p>Good question! Every student will perform (with a microphone) in each class, including the first one, allowing you to receive instant feedback. More importantly, you will get constructive feedback from the instructor. The Class meets once a week for 6 weeks.
  <p><strong>Q: Can you tell me about the graduation performance at Carolines Comedy Club?
  </strong>    
  <p>You will perform in front of family and friends on a Sunday afternoon. All those in attendance will be either friends or family, virtually guaranteeing an audience that is supportive and encouraging. Your performance will total 5 minutes in length. Two weeks later, you will receive your videotape. Lastly, to ensure that things run even more smoothly, we hire an Emcee who has an understanding of the special nature of the show.
  <p><strong>Q: How many people are in each class?</strong>  
  <p>The Stand-up Level I class takes 19 people. It's something we have put a fair amount of thought into. Not only do we often lose some people (due to the normal attrition), but we've found that there is a minimum number of students/people required to make the performance aspect of the class both productive and realistic. </p>
