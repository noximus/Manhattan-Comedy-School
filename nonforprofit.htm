    Quiet please. There&#8217;s a lady onstage. Although, with a mouth like that&#8230; 
    Ann Kaplan normally speaks at nonprofit and higher education conferences, 
    not at nightclubs. But on the night Chris Rock was shaking up Oscar tradition 
    in Hollywood, Kaplan was debuting her standup routine at Caroline&#8217;s 
    Comedy Club in New York City.<br>
    &#8220;A lot of people give me advice on how to handle relationships,&#8221; 
    Kaplan told the audience. &#8220;My mother&#8217;s advice is, &#8216;From 
    now on, don&#8217;t date anyone who hasn&#8217;t been in therapy.&#8217;&#8221;<br>
    This is the economic consultant&#8217;s first experience in front of a live 
    audience, the culmination of a six-week class at a comedy school sponsored 
    by Caroline&#8217;s. On a bill with her fellow classmates, she&#8217;s wowing 
    with the crowd of friends, family, and comedy club hangers-on.<br>
    &#8220;So, I&#8217;ve been hanging out with this guy, and I take him to a 
    party, and one of my girlfriends comes up to me and says, &#8216;Don&#8217;t 
    you feel a little weird that your date&#8217;s mother is younger than you 
    are?&#8217; Like that&#8217;s my fault. Like when she was 20, I held a gun 
    to her head and forced her to bear children.&#8221;<br>
    As director of the Voluntary Support of Education (VSE) survey and the VSE 
    Data Miner application at the Council of Aid to Education (CAE), a unit of 
    the RAND Corporation, Kaplan doesn&#8217;t always have the opportunity to 
    yuk it up. Offstage, she oversees a major national online survey on higher 
    education and private pre-college fundraising.<br>
    It&#8217;s her job to analyze data on higher education giving and estimate 
    the total philanthropic support of higher education institutions and the underlying 
    trends.<br>
    But on Oscar night at Caroline&#8217;s, her job is to get the audience laughing, 
    and she did with a series of jokes, most of which simply can&#8217;t be printed 
    here. While her routine isn&#8217;t as raunchy as most of her fellow classmates&#8217; 
    acts, it still isn&#8217;t what you expect to hear during the typical conference 
    presentation.<br>
    &#8220;Gee&#8230; I don&#8217;t know why I do this. I don&#8217;t know why 
    I do anything really. I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m doing this. You are 
    aware, right, that we performers, do not get on iota of this two-drink minimum, 
    which is so condescending. I mean, who ever drinks one drink? Do you really 
    need it in writing that two drinks is the minimum?&#8221;<br>
    After a few experiences with avant-garde theatre troupes like the Bread &amp; 
    Puppet Theatre Company and the Performance Group, where Spaulding Gray and 
    others got their start, she found her niche in the profit world. In 1991, 
    she became the research director and a writer and editor for the AAFRC Trust 
    for Philanthropy. Before joining the CAE in 2002, Kaplan worked as a consultant 
    on various research projects with Indiana University and Perdue University&#8217;s 
    Center on Philanthropy, as well as the Council for Aid to Education and the 
    Foundation Center.<br>
    Much of Kaplan&#8217;s routine relates to the classic standup comic theme 
    of the frustrations of dating. Kaplan&#8217;s twist is descriptions of cyber 
    hookups facilitated by instant messaging chat conversations with younger men 
    who don&#8217;t seem to know or care how to spell simple words like &#8220;you&#8221; 
    when they make their coarse propositions online.<br>
    &#8220;Oh, I know people who think that in instant messaging spelling doesn&#8217;t 
    count, but, OK, spelling so counts. Particularly if you&#8217;re 21 and haven&#8217;t 
    developed an interesting personality, yet.<br>
    Seriously, kids. Is the word y-o-u so ling that you&#8217;re going to get 
    carpal tunnel syndrome type that whole sucker out.<br>
    She explained that she has more meaningful relationships with men who have 
    different priorities.<br>
    &#8220;In the Fire Island Pine, two drinks is breakfast,&#8221; she tells 
    the audience. &#8220;I know this because last August, my treasured friend 
    William invited me out to his share in the Pines. It&#8217;s so beautiful 
    out there. It breathes life into the concept that not all gorgeous men have 
    it as their mission in life to screw women. It was awesome. It was like one 
    of those MasterCard ads. You know those ads? Here, I&#8217;ll do the ad for 
    you. It goes like this: train fare:$23; ferry ticket: $12; men cooking for 
    you three days: priceless.&#8221;<br>
    Chances are she won&#8217;t be covering this particular topic at the next 
    nonprofit conference, but Kaplan still hopes to bring some of her onstage 
    moxie to her conference speeches. &#8220;I do a lot of public speaking about 
    charities, which makes me feel comfortable on stage,&#8221; she said. Kaplan 
    sensed that some humor could liven up her presentation. &#8220;I thought it 
    would be helpful for public speaking where I&#8217;m not always relaxed. I&#8217;m 
    talking about numbers with graphs, and sometimes I think some of these people 
    must be like, &#8216;Hey, it&#8217;s cocktail hour.&#8217;&#8221;<br>
    Her experience onstage from her earlier theatre days also helped, though it 
    was much different from either the comedy club circuit or conferences. &#8220;I 
    interned with an environmental theatre group in the 1970s, and I did a lot 
    of political theatre in college,&#8221; Kaplan recalled. &#8220;But I never 
    did a standard production. It&#8217;s always been off the beaten trail.&#8221;<br>
    Kaplan said that she gets a rush from being in the limelight, especially n 
    her new setting. &#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of fun,&#8221; she declares. &#8220;You 
    do a routine over and over and over again, and you do it in front of people 
    who haven&#8217;t heard it before.&#8221;<br>
    One family member got a sneak preview of the routine. &#8220;I did it for 
    my daughter,&#8221; Kaplan said, &#8220;and she said, &#8216;Well, maybe other 
    people will find it funny.&#8217; But they told me, &#8216;That&#8217;s a 
    little bitter.&#8217; So I kind of reworked everything.&#8221;<br>
    Kaplan might even decide to do a routine about her day job, which she mentioned 
    only briefly at her Caroline&#8217;s appearance. &#8220;I have other routines, 
    but I could only do five minutes tonight, so I just did this one,&#8221; she 
    explained. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to do one about my job. But I haven&#8217;t 
    thought of the hook for that yet.&#8221;<br>
    There is this one about the two statisticians who walk into a bar&#8230;</font></p>
